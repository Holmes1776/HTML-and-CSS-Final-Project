                        Back in the days of the Wii I practically begged my parents to 
                        buy me a copy of Super Mario Galaxy 2 as it looked like the 
                        coolest game ever at the time and for much of my life it was.
                        Although I did not grow up with its previous title being the 
                        original Super Mario Galaxy, I still respect is as the Superior 
                        entry as the 2nd game copies almost everything from the original.
                        Super Mario Galaxy I would consider to be the best Mario game in 
                        the entire seris due to its amazing gameplay, level design, killer
                        sound track, and above all else its absolute unique awe-inspiring 
                        aura and ability to delight the player.

                        I like many others in my generation practically grew up watching
                        various minecraft let's plays on Youtube from Youtubers such as 
                        DanTDM, PrestonPlays, and PopularMMO's just to name a few. It was
                        and is a game with endless creativity and possiblities. Just about
                        any structure you can imagine can be replicated in Minecraft. The 
                        plethera of mod support for the game can make the game very 
                        interesting and fun with new possiblities. Although I may sound
                        cheesy saying this it doesn't make it any less true.

                        Fallout 3 was one of my very first experiences with an open-world
                        game and Fallout:New Vegas is by far the best in the seris. This 
                        game unlike other entries in the seris has a very large amount of
                        side-quests and opertunities the player can indulge in. The setting 
                        being in a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas, works well with the franchises
                        aesthetic. The game, like other Bethesda titles always does well with
                        encouraging the player to explore the map offering many many hours of
                        fun ahead of the player.

                        For what I can say about the Witcher 3 is that everything this game
                        sets out to accomplish, it executes upon quite masterfully. The Witcher
                        3: The Wild Hunt is another open world title set in a fantasy setting
                        where you play as a Witcher (A genertically enhanced monster hunter)
                        as you search around the world trying to find your adopted daughter 
                        Ciri while evading the Wild Hunt. The game features terrific combat,
                        and engaging story, great graphics, wonderful world building, and 
                        diversive and unique monsters to challenge the player.

                        Halo 2 was the very first M rated Game I have ever played and It
                        still stands as my favorite FPS. Releasing on the original Xbox
                        back in 2004, the game is an upgrade from Halo Combate Evolved 
                        in almost every conceivable catagory. The gameplay has aged well,
                        the world building spectacular, the characters great, and the level
                        designs iconic. Not to mention the games impact on the industry by
                        introducing online multiplayer to many leading to one of the biggest
                        genres in gaming today.

                    <h2>
                        Ocarina of Time I would consider to be the best Zelda game ever
                        released as subjective of a take it is but I have reason. The game
                        is most famous for its seemless transition from the traditional
                        overhead 2d gameplay like in previous entries to a new camera angle
                        behind Link which has become the standard for many different 3D
                        games to this day. The sound track in this game is perhapes one of
                        if not the most iconic in all of gaming and the graphics/artstyle 
                        of the game aging like wine in my opinion considering the game's age.
                        I think above all else however it is the de facto Zelda game for many
                        people. While other entries while fantastic like Breath of the Wild
                        have made their own footing and are received with immense praise, 
                        more often than not do people draw a compairison to how it stacks up
                        against Ocarina as I would describe it as the literal perfect Zelda 
                        game as it gets everything right when it comes to its execution.

                        It was a tough pick for me but I do have to put Skyrim here on list
                        over Oblivion as I have come to the conclusion that I just like this 
                        game better. Skryim has had a terrific impact on the industry for its 
                        incorperation of an open-world with seemingly endless supply of side-quests 
                        and objectives for the player to embark on. Even though the game suffers
                        from many bugs and glitches that still persit to this very day unresolved,
                        it has never deterred from my enjoyment of it. The shere replayablity of 
                        the game is fantastic as I may play the game as this class and go do this 
                        thing or I play the game again and play as this class and go do this other
                        thing and then some. The games shere ability to create new experiences on
                        brand new playthroughs purly based on its shere size has made the game
                        its reputation. Not to mention having one of the largest modding communities
                        for the game adding many many more possiblities and fun to be had with it.

                        enough that others are obsessed with any and all things anime and I try
                        my best to seperate myself from those rather passionate people, I cannot
                        deney my love for the Ace Attorney Trilogy. Originally released by Capcom
                        for the GBA in Japan to be later brought over to the west on the Nintendo
                        DS in the 2000s, the game has you role play as a defense attorney who is 
                        tasked with helping various clients who are falsely accused of a crime 
                        (usually murder) by gathing and collecting evidence, talking to witnesses,
                        and presenting your case in court. While this may seem basic to some, it
                        has left an immense impression on me through its shere ability to intimiate
                        the player through its bone-chilling tension very expertly highlighted 
                        through its brillant sound-track. The situations the player will find
                        themselves in will have them sitting on the edge of their seat as the
                        events unfold and the truth revealed.

                        story and world building. The game has the player play as Kratos, a Greek
                        god that has relocated himself in a norse setting as him and his son Atreus
                        embark on a journey to fulfill Kratos's wife's wish of having her ashes 
                        sacred atop the tallest peak in all the 9 realms. This game is a soft reboot
                        from the original trillogy and its spinoffs now taking place in an entirly 
                        new setting with new gods and characters than before with new over the
                        shoulder gameplay. The game also features excellent and creative 
                        cinimatography having the entire game all done in one shot and never cutting
                        away allowing the player to keep in constant pace with the action and events.
                        The voice acting is top tier as well with actors such as Christopher Judge as 
                        Kratos and Sunny Suljic playing Atreus who work all very well off of each other.
                        All in all between the setting, characters, and story, this game has earned its 
                        spot as one of my most favorite  off all time. Much the same can be said 
                        about its sequel God of War Ragnorok as well.

                        There is no game that I care for more than Rockstar's 2018 masterpeice, Red 
                        Dead Redemption 2. I cannot describe in words how much this games execution
                        is surpassed by nothing. Taking place in 1899 at the turn of the century.
                        The player plays as Arthur Morgan, a member of a gang under the leadership 
                        of Dutch van der lin as both him and the gang try to run away from the law 
                        in a fictional western american landscape as industrial advancements hinder
                        the gang's ability to live a free life away from civilization and government.
                        The story in this game is straight up the best I have ever experienced in a 
                        game let alone all other type of media have that be movies and tv shows between
                        both the plot and the characters that make it up and is ready to make even the 
                        most stable-minded individual begin to tear up with its conclusion. The gameplay
                        does not disappoint either. The game is perhapes the most realistic game that has
                        been made to date featuring real world mechanics that many would consider 
                        completely unecessary but combined adds to an immersive effect not attained by
                        any other game of its kind in my opinion. The map is also very large as well 
                        and chock full of different side quests and opportunities that incentivise the
                        player to explore to their hearts content. There will never be enough for me to
                        say about this game so I will end off by saying that if anyone ever a game featuring
                        an open world with amazing characters, graphics, gameplay, and story, there is none
                        better than Red dead Redemption 2.
